## Local development setup

1. Set up a [Paper server](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).
    - **NOTE:** Use a file called `start.bat` to start the server.
2. Create a file named `.env` at the root of this repository (e.g. where the `pom.xml` file is).
3. Create the following variables:

```dotenv
SERVER_PATH=<path to your server folder (the folder containing the plugins folder)>
```
